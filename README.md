Optimization tool for reducing emissions from energy self-sufficient accommodation in international disaster response operations by implementing photovoltaic generators, wind generators and battery storage systems

# Introduction: 
This article delineates the optimization tool for reducing emissions from energy self-sufficient shelters in international disaster response operations developed as a component of the POWERBASE research project, employing the Python programming language. The system's functionality encompasses the configuration and optimization of energy systems within shelters demonstrating energy self-sufficiency, particularly in the context of international disaster relief operations. The system interface employs a graphical user interface, through which users can input pertinent information such as coordinates, transportation logistics, load profiles, and utilization periods. The tool calculates the CO₂ emissions for the actual system (electrical load coverage through the use of diesel generator units) and determines the optimum power output of the diesel generator for the configured energy system. The PV generator, wind generator, and battery storage system are subsequently integrated into the energy system (new system) and optimized with respect to the reduction of CO₂ emissions. The tool calculates the reduction in CO₂ emissions for the new system relative to the existing system without renewable energies, as well as the optimal outputs of the photovoltaic (PV) generator, wind generator, and battery storage system.  The CO₂ emissions resulting from the transportation and operation of energy systems are duly considered in this analysis.
